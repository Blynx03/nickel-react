        <p className='home-para'>
          Nickel is a common metal that is found in many everyday objects, such as jewelry, coins, zippers, and even some foods. 
          However, some people can develop an allergic reaction to nickel, which can result in a skin rash or other symptoms when 
          they come into contact with the metal.

          In the context of nickel allergy, the term "nickel point" is sometimes used to refer to the threshold level of nickel 
          exposure that can trigger an allergic reaction in sensitive individuals. The exact nickel point can vary depending on 
          a person's individual sensitivity, but it is generally believed that a nickel exposure of 0.5 micrograms per square 
          centimeter of skin per week can be enough to cause an allergic reaction in some people.

          It's worth noting that nickel allergies are relatively common, and can affect people of all ages. If you suspect that 
          you may have a nickel allergy, it's a good idea to talk to your doctor or an allergist for advice on how to manage your 
          symptoms and avoid nickel exposure.
