# Nickel Point - Nickel Allergy Tracker

Nickel Point is a user-friendly web application designed to assist individuals with nickel allergies in monitoring their nickel intake through daily food consumption. Nickel is a common metal found in everyday objects and some foods, and for those with nickel sensitivity, exposure can lead to allergic reactions, such as skin rashes.

## About Nickel Allergy

Nickel allergy is a condition in which individuals develop an allergic reaction to nickel upon contact with the metal. The term "nickel point" refers to the threshold level of nickel exposure that can trigger an allergic reaction in sensitive individuals. Although the exact nickel point varies among individuals, it is generally believed that a nickel exposure of 0.5 micrograms per square centimeter of skin per week can be sufficient to cause a reaction.

Nickel allergies are relatively common and can affect people of all ages. If you suspect that you have a nickel allergy, it's crucial to consult a doctor or allergist for guidance on managing symptoms and reducing nickel exposure.
